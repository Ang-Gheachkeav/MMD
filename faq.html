                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Eligibility for NBC's monetary operations is determined by several factors including the institution's licensing status, capital adequacy, and compliance history. Specific criteria are outlined in the Monetary Operations Framework. Counterparties must be licensed banks or financial institutions in Cambodia and meet minimum capital and governance requirements.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                    What is your reference rate?
                    <span>+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The Reference Rate is the target interest rate in Cambodia,, and it is the rate on LPCO 7 days 
                        set by the central bank.It is the interest rate charged when the central bank provides liquidity 
                        to commercial banks and financial institutions. In other words,it is the rate applied to loans that banks
                        may borrow from the central bank.
                        Because this rate influences banks’ funding costs, it affects the interest rates they charge and  
                        offer in the market. Many financial institutions use the Reference Ratewhen setting the interest rate on their loans.
                        For example, when the Reference Rate is decreased, banks typically reduce interest rates in the interbank market, on loans 
                        to customers,and on savings and deposits. In contrast, when the Reference Rate is raised,banks usually increase these rates accordingly.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">
                    How do interest rates affect inflation?
                    <span>+</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Interest rates influence economic activity by affecting the spending and saving decisions of 
                        households and businesses, which in turn shape inflationary pressures in the economy.
                        When interest rates increase, borrowing costs rise. Higher repayments on mortgages and loans
                        reduce households’ disposable income, limiting their ability to spend on goods and services. 
                        At the same time, higher interest rates make saving more attractive and discourage borrowing for 
                        consumption and investment. As a result,overall demand in the economy tends to moderate.
                        With weaker demand, businesses are less likely to raise prices. Slower price increases
                        contribute to a reduction in inflation.Conversely, when interest rates decline, borrowing becomes
                        less costly and repayments on existing loans decrease. This increases households’ disposable income 
                        and encourages both consumption and investment. Lower returns on savings may also reduce incentives 
                        to save,further supporting spending.Stronger demand allows businesses greater scope to increase prices.
                        If sustained, this can lead to higher inflation.</p>

                        money in the banking system. By managing liquidity, the central bank helps keep short-term interest rates 
                        close to the Reference Rate, which in turn influences borrowing, saving, spending, and inflation in the economy.</p>
